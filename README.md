This project calculates the **number under 1,000,000** that produces the **longest Collatz chain** and visualizes the sequence using **Chart.js**.

> ✅ Developed as part of a university-level JavaScript homework assignment.

---

## 📌 What is the Collatz Conjecture?

The **Collatz sequence** is generated by taking any positive integer:

- If the number is even → divide it by 2  
- If the number is odd → multiply it by 3 and add 1  
- Repeat until the number reaches 1  

The challenge is:  
➡️ *Which number under 1,000,000 produces the longest chain?*
